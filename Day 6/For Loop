 Nth Fibonacci Number

Provided 'n' you have to find out the n-th Fibonacci Number. Handle edges cases like when 'n' = 1 or 'n' = 2 by using conditionals like if else and return what's expected.

"Indexing is start from 1"


Example :
Input: 6

Output: 8

Explanation: The number is ‘6’ so we have to find the “6th” Fibonacci number.
So by using the given formula of the Fibonacci series, we get the series:    
[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
So the “6th” element is “8” hence we get the output.

int fib(int n)
{
    int a = 0, b = 1, c, i;
    if (n == 0)
        return a;
    for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return b;
}
 
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout << fib(n);
    return 0;
}
